Welcome to the 2019 Data Science Challenge!
===========================================

For this competition you will clone this repository and complete as many of the stages
of the challenge as possible in the eight hours available.

In a nut shell...

1. Fork this repository.
2. Open a _pull request_ from your fork to the _submission_ branch.
3. As you complete tasks, _commit_ your results.

When you _commit_ a change to a branch that you have already initiated a _pull request_
from it will automatically be reflected in the pull request. At the end of the eight hours,
only the commits that where pushed _prior_ to the deadline will be considered.
