### Plan
My goal is to extract all the data labled for Antarctica from years 1973 onwards

#### Why 1973?
NOAA in their readme says data from 1973 to the present is typically the most complete, this means we have the lowest likelihood of missing data.

#### What are we extracting?
Station number
Date
Name
TEMP (Mean tempurature throughout the day)
MAX
MIN
